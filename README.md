# Mission-to-Mars
Help a junior data scientist, Robin, to write a script that would gather all the information from searches about the mission to Mars from all over the web and display it in a central location. Build a web application that will scrape new data every time it tells it to, with a click of a button. 
1. Use python to navigate the webpages to collect the right information
2. Store data and images in MongoDB 
3. Display on Flask and use Bootstrap to customize the webpage layout

## Overview
Adjust the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images:<br>
Use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.

## Result
- Deliverable 1: Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
- Deliverable 2: Update the Web App with Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
- Deliverable 3: Add Bootstrap 3 Components
